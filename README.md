Find me around the web 🌎 <a href="https://shuvam.xyz"><b>right here</b></a>. If you want to talk about things, reach out on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/shuvam360">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/the_distorted_aura"> Instagram</a> 🏓
I love music and good puns. You'd find me build and break things pretty regularly.
